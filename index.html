    <p>
        I am Shobhit. I'm interested in way too many things ranging from psychology, anthropology, mathematics, physics, philosophy and you name it.
        I started editing close to 5 years back as just a hobby where I made funny Youtube skits and fast forward to today, I've worked with companies in this area and earned a lil money as well!
        I have an exam tomorrow by the way and I'm doing this so I hope I pass :)
